## Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch Your API Testing Tool">
  Open your chosen API testing platform. If you are new to the tool, familiarize yourself with its interface or refer to its official documentation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a New Request">
    1. Create a new request within the tool.
2. Name your request (e.g., "Create Bot") and the method wil be a `POST` and this is the base url `https://chat-app.fanheat.com/v2` and the endpoint is `/bot`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Authorization Header">
   1. Go to the **Headers** section of your tool.
2. Add a new key-value pair:
   - **Key**: `Authorization`
   - **Value**: `Bearer <API_KEY>`

   Replace `<API_KEY>` with your actual API key provided by the API provider. This ensures the request is authenticated.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Specify Content-Type">
   1. In the **Headers** section, add another key-value pair:
   - **Key**: `Content-Type`
   - **Value**: `application/json`

   This header tells the API server that the request body is formatted in JSON.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Define the Request Body and Send">
    Enter the following JSON structure:

   ```json
   {
       "name": "BotName",                
       "freeform": "Bot description",    
       "kv_pairs": {                     
           "key1": "value1",
           "key2": "value2"
       }
   }
   ```

   Replace:
   - **`BotName`**: The name of the bot.
   - **`Bot description`**: A description of the botâ€™s personality.
   - **`key1` and `key2`**: Key-value pairs for additional metadata customization.
