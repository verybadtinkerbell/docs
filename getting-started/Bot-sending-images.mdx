This tutorial guides you through managing images for bots via API requests. You will learn how to upload images to a bot's content library and delete them when no longer needed.

## **Prerequisites**
Before proceeding, ensure the following:
1. You know the `bot_id` of the bot you are managing.
2. You have a valid `<SECRET_TOKEN>` for authentication.
3. You have an image file ready to upload.


## **Uploading Images to the Bot Library**

![User Send Image](/images/bot_img.png)
Images can be added to a bot's library by making a `POST` request to the `/content` endpoint.

Hereâ€™s how to upload an image using the Talend API Tester:

1. Open Talend API Tester and select the `POST` method.
2. Enter the URL: 
```
http://chat-app.fanheat.com/v2/content?bot_id={{BOT_ID}}.
```
**Example**
```
https://chat-app.fanheat.com/v2/content?bot_id=3fc117da-e647-446c-bc95-e498b92be6af
```

<Note>Pass the following parameters: </Note>
>  - **bot_id**: The unique identifier of the [bot](/quickstart).
>  - **content**: The image file you want to upload.

3. In the **Headers** section, add:
   - `Authorization`: `Bearer <SECRET_TOKEN>`
4. In the **Body** section, choose `multipart/form-data` as the content type.
   - Add a field named `content` and upload your image file (e.g., `image.png`).
5. Send the request and review the response.

### **Response**
On a successful request, the API will return a response indicating the image has been added to the bot's library. The response might include details like the `content_id` of the uploaded image.
```json
{
    "id": "1cf027f9-5ec2-4d0f-8931-430cecb1bcb8.jpg",
    "content_type": "image/jpeg",
    "etag": "\"78de70ac613d9f763c62e31ecc5f11bd\"",
    "filename": "447297286_1038079274404560_7786460498777728743_n.jpg",
    "url": "https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/clonetwin/thumbnail-1cf027f9-5ec2-4d0f-8931-430cecb1bcb8.jpg",

## **Deleting Images from the Bot Library**
![User Send Image](/images/bot_img_delete.png)

When you need to remove an image from the bot's library, send a `DELETE` request to the appropriate API endpoint.

1. Open Talend API Tester and select the `DELETE` method.
2. Enter the URL: `http://chat-app.fanheat.com/v2/content/{{BOT_ID}}/{{CONTENT_ID}}`.

<Note>Pass the following parameters: </Note>
>   - `bot_id`: The unique identifier of the bot.
>   - `content_id`: The unique identifier of the content (image) you want to delete.

3. In the **Headers** section, add:
   - `Authorization`: `Bearer <SECRET_TOKEN>`
4. Send the request and review the response.

### **Response**
On a successful request, the API will return a confirmation that the image has been deleted.

```json
null

```
