## **Prerequisites**
1. Access to the API endpoint and a valid token for authorization.
2. A command-line interface (CLI) or an API testing tool like Postman.

The first step is to upload your image to the server. Once the image is uploaded, the server will return an ID that you will use in subsequent requests.

### **Steps to Upload an Image**
1. Use the `API` or `curl` command or your preferred HTTP client to upload the image.
2. Provide the `Authorization` token in the header.
3. Attach your image file to the request body.

### **Example Request**

### **Example Response**
The server will return a response with the image ID:
```json
{
    "id": "879b09df-3117-47e1-9afa-008514368578"
}

```

<Note>Save the `id` value (`879b09df-3117-47e1-9afa-008514368578` in this example), as you will need it in the next step.</Note>

  
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use the Image ID in a Message">
    Once you have the `image_id`, you can include it in your message by using the `/complete` endpoint.

### **Parameters**
- `conversation_id`: The ID of the conversation where the image is sent.
- `bot_id`: The ID of the bot you are interacting with.
- `messages`: The conversation history in JSON format.
- `message`: A caption accompanying the image (can also be an empty string).
- `image_id`: The ID of the image returned from Step 1.
- `min_delay`: Minimum delay for the bot response (in seconds).
- `max_delay`: Maximum delay for the bot response (in seconds).

### **Example Request**
Here’s how to include the image in a message:
```http
POST http://chat-app.fanheat.com/v2/complete
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <YOURTOKEN>

{
  "conversation_id": "789",
  "bot_id": "c5e84988-0192-4135-ac3b-4348bed724cb",
  "messages": [
    { "bot": true, "content": "[hey sexy, what are you up to tonight.. ]" },
    { "bot": false, "content": "[not much, what about you]" },
    { "bot": true, "content": "[not much either, just chilling at home. What do you look like??]" }
  ],
  "message": "this is me",
  "image_id": "73b04d18-96fe-481e-b9e3-2257dba3a2cd",
  "min_delay": 5,
  "max_delay": 600
}
```

### **Explanation**
- `conversation_id`: Specifies which conversation the message belongs to.
- `bot_id`: Identifies the bot interacting in the conversation.
- `messages`: Contains previous messages exchanged in the chat.
- `message`: Adds a caption or comment to the image (optional).
- `image_id`: The ID of the image you uploaded in Step 1.
- `min_delay` and `max_delay`: Define the range of delay before the bot responds.

### **Example Response**
Upon success, you’ll receive a response confirming the bot’s reply and further interaction in the conversation:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "response": {
    "bot_reply": "Nice photo! What else are you up to tonight?",
    ...
  }
}
```
  </Step>
